# Hello World

The most basic flowdown conversation is just plain text. Each line is one
utterance that is spoken by the assistant.

```
In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that I've been turning over in my mind ever since.

'Whenever you feel like criticizing any one,' he told me,

'just remember that all the people in this world haven't had the advantages that you've had.'
