# Introduction

**flowdown** is a minimal markup language for writing conversations,
specifically for the [voiceflow](https://github.com/voiceflow) platform. It can
be thought of a 'voiceflow programming language' of sorts.

The fundamental guiding principles of **flowdown** are as follows:
- writing a conversation should be 'text' first, meaning that any functionality
  should be built as syntax around the dialogue.
- a conversation should read as it flows - control flow should be obvious to
  follow and syntax should not be cryptic
- conversations should be fun to write and not at all tedious!

Also please note that **flowdown** is very much still a prototype. It lacks
many essential features and also may be buggy. If you run into any issues or
have feedback, please leave an issue in the [github
repo](https://github.com/MrPicklePinosaur/flowdown).
