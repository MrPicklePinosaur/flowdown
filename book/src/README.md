# Introduction

**flowdown** is a minimal markup language for writing conversations,
specifically for the [voiceflow](https://github.com/voiceflow) platform. It can
be thought of a 'voiceflow programming language' of sorts.

## principles
- writing a conversation should be 'text' first, meaning that any functionality
  should be built as syntax around the dialogue.
- a conversation should read as it flows - control flow should be obvious to
  follow and syntax should not be cryptic
- conversations should be fun to write and not at all tedious!
