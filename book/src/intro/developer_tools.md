# Developer Tools

An important aspect of a language is not just the language itself, but also the
ecosystem and set of tools around the language to make development fun and
productive. Here are some developer tool (prototypes) that are included.

## Vim

A vim plugin with syntax highlighting can be installed with the following (for vim-plug users)
```
Plug 'MrPicklePinosaur/flowdown', { 'rtp': 'tools/vim' }
```

## Vscode

Vscode extension is coming soon...
